## ismycommitmessageuseful

ismycommitmessageuseful is a proof-of-concept project that rates your commit messages using machine learning. It will rate your messages from 0% to 100% usefulness.

#### Try it out here: https://ismycommitmessageuseful.github.io

The model is trained using a large set of messages from well-known open-source repositories.

The training process is not finalized and will be adjusted. Currently a n-gram bag-of-words trainer is used to learn from the messages.

To improve the model accuracy, you rate the usefulness of commit messages in dataset on the webpage.
